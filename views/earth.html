<p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and as far as we know, the only planet to support life.  It has only one
    natural satellite, the moon, and is approximately 4.5 billion years old.  It takes the Earth around 365 days to
    orbit the Sun, and will complete one rotation in around 24 hours.  Around 70% of its surface is covered in water
    and it is the largest terrestrial planet in the Solar System.</p>
